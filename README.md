## Description

I built this app using React Router, React, Yup, and Tailwind CSS.
I used React Router to quickly navigate to the main task.
I tried to create reusable components and used Context instead of something like Redux, since I believe state managers are not necessary for such a small app.
I also organized the code by separating different parts of the app into different folders.
Overall, I tried to approach the task thoroughly and didn’t skip over parts that could have been simplified too much.
Of course, the app can still be improved further with many changes that could enhance the UI and UX.

## What i used in this app

- 🔒 TypeScript by default
- 🎉 TailwindCSS for styling
- 📖 React Router docs
- 📖 React Context
- 📖 Yup for validation
